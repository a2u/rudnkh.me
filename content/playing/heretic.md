I've always loved dark fantasy aesthetics, and Heretic remains one of the best representatives of the genre. Built on id Tech 1 (the Doom engine), it perfectly captures that gritty, supernatural atmosphere.

First played this back in the 90s on MS-DOS. Recently revisited it through the Steam release with enhanced graphics, improved music, and proper mouse support. Pure nostalgia.
