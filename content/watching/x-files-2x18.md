Epic continuation of Denis Villeneuve's adaptation. The scale, visuals, and sound design are absolutely stunning. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya deliver powerful performances.

The way Villeneuve translates Herbert's complex narrative into pure cinema is masterful. Every frame is meticulously crafted. Hans Zimmer's score elevates the entire experience.

Best watched in IMAX.
